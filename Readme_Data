1.Seed fate Beech Seeds
Information about the fate of beech seeds - Fagus sylvatica -placed in the 4 sites in Northern Germany during Autumn .
See exact locations at Mittelman et al., 2024- Forest composition shapes seed-rodent interactions in a gradient of broadleaves and conifers: https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.14711
Methods use to access seed fate was ‘tagged wire’ – a stainless-steel wire of 10 – to 15cm was attached to the beech seeds with a colorful flagtape in the end in order to find the seeds.
Each line is a checkage of an individual seed
Variables:
Tree N - Number of the closet tree to where the seed pile was placed
Id_seed_pile – unique identifier of that seed pile
Id_seed – unique identifier of that seed
Date – exact calendar date of checkage
Day_Number – Checkage day of seeds
Fate – What happened to the seed – I=Intact/ Non-harvested – P=Preyed upon/ eaten, M=Missing/Removed but with unknown fate, D=Dispersed
   Notice that seeds that are carried away are not considered dispersed, seeds have to be caried away and alive to be considered dispersed. Some Preyed seeds have information on distance because they were carried and then eaten
Change_since_last_check – Did something happened to the seed since the last check? Y or N
Beech_seeds_perm2 – Number of estimated beech seeds in the specific plot that the seed was tracked. Estimation by ground quadrats
Mice_Plot_density – Density of Apodemus mice (individuals per hectare) in the specific plot that the seed was tracked. Estimation was done by spatially explicit mark-recapture
Vole_density - Density of bank voles Myorde glaerous (individuals per hectare) in the specific plot that the seed was tracked. Estimation was done by spatially explicit mark-recapture
Understory_coverage – Total raw number of understory plants between 30 and 80 cm in height per plot, counted in 6 quadrats of 100m2 (10 x 10 m) 
Species_APA- Area Potentially Available for either Norway Spruce, European beech or Douglas-fir in the plot. See Glatthorn, J. (2021). A spatially explicit index for tree species or trait diversity at neighborhood and stand level. Ecological Indicators, 130, 108073.
Species_Basal_area- Total and percentual basal areas for either Norway Spruce, European beech or Douglas-fir in the plot
